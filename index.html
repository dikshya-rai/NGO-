            <h3>Project 2</h3><h4>"World Heritage Volunteers"</h4>
            <p>The World Heritage Volunteers (WHV) Initiative encourages young people to undertake concrete preservation activities in action camps organised by youth organisations and institutions in cooperation with multiple stakeholders and partners.

                The initiative mobilizes national and international volunteers through hands-on and awareness-raising activities for the conservation of our common cultural and natural heritage. Over the past ten years, the WHV Initiative has grown tremendously with increasing interest and appreciation for World Heritage protection, preservation and promotion.
                
                Up to now, the initiative implemented a total of 477 action camps at 130 sites in 57 countries, involving 95 organisations and 4780 volunteers</p>
